Husky Design

Constructor 
	Must keep track of every object within two move steps away
Eat Method
	Return true only if it is safe (within two moves away)
Fight method
	This is really hard…Some can disguise themselves, and I don’t know how to counter exactly…
Movemethod
	Moves towards closest enemy if I think I can beat it, otherwise run away from threats, and else, move towards closest food or same husky
